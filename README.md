# PillNote - Your Pill Tracker

PillNote is a simple app built with Flutter to help you track and remember your pill and supplement intake. Whether it's daily medication, vitamins, or other supplements, this app makes it easy to set reminders, log your intake, and stay on top of your health.

## About This Project

PillNote was a fun project that allowed me to dive back into mobile development with Flutter. After taking a break from app development, it felt great to refresh my skills and build something useful. Flutter's simplicity and flexibility made the development process enjoyable, and I'm excited to continue learning and improving my mobile dev skills.
